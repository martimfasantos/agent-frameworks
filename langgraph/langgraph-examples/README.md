## How to setup

### Virtual environment

Create a simple virtual environment with:

`python3 -m venv .venv`

And install the requirements with:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### .env

See .env.example and create a .env (on the root of the repository).
You need to get an open AI endpoint and key and fill them in.

### Jupyter

Make sure you select the correct kernel when running the notebooks.

**Note**: All the necessary packages should already be installed in the virtual environment.
