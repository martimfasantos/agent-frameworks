# autogen-project

First, if you haven't already, install [pdm](https://pdm.fming.dev/):

Then, navigate to your project directory and install the dependencies:

```bash
pdm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project based on the `.env.example` file.

Now, you can run the project by executing the following command:

```bash
pdm run autogen
```

or, if you want a chat UI for the project, you can run:

```bash
pdm run autogen-chat
```
